# MMI Physics Simulations in VPython

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the "Matematičke Metode za Informatičare" (MMI) project, featuring a collection of physics simulations developed in VPython. These simulations aim to demonstrate various projectile motion scenarios, including vertical shots, oblique shots, horizontal shots, and realistic projectile movements.

## Simulations

1. **Vertical Shot Simulation:**
   - *Description:* Illustrates the physics of a vertically launched projectile.
   - *Usage:* User enters initial velocity, and starts simulation.

2. **Oblique Shot Simulation:**
   - *Description:* Demonstrates projectile motion at an angle to the horizontal plane.
   - *Usage:* User enters initial velocity, initial height, an angle of the shot, and starts simulation.

3. **Horizontal Shot Simulation:**
   - *Description:* Explores the dynamics of a horizontally projected projectile.
   - *Usage:* User enters initial velocity, initial height of the projectile, and starts simulation.

4. **Realistic Projectile Movement:**
   - *Description:* Simulates a projectile's movement with realistic physics considerations.
   - *Usage:* User enters initial velocity, point of start, air resistance, time of the movement, and starts simulation.
